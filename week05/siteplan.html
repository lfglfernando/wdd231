      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage features a hero image to capture users' attention, and within that section, there’s a call to action inviting users to join our community of companies, which directs them to our join page. Below, we can see the current day’s weather along with the forecast for the next three days. We also have upcoming events for the next few days, and at the bottom, we showcase companies that hold either a silver or gold membership. Users can access their websites, and these companies are promoted randomly each time the page is loaded, displaying different companies.

      <h3>Business Directory</h3>
      <p>
        On this business directory page, we have a list of all the companies that are part of our membership group, with two buttons: one to display the companies in a grid format and the other to show them in a list format. Clicking on each company will take you to their website, and each card contains all the information about that company.      </p>

        On the Join page, we have a form where company owners can register their businesses and obtain a membership so they can enjoy the privileges that each membership offers. Upon submitting the form, their form data will be displayed on another page. On the right side of the Join page, there will be four cards showing the four different memberships, along with a button that will display the details of each membership in a modal.      </p>

      <p>         
        In our home page, we aim to create a welcoming atmosphere with user-friendly navigation. The wireframe may not reflect our chosen color scheme and background imagery, which will be carefully curated to resonate with our brand's identity and offer an engaging visual experience.

      <h3>Business Directory</h3>
      <p>     
        Our Business Directory section will showcase a diverse of companies, but the wireframe doesn't convey the interactive features. Visitors can click on each company to access detailed information, images, and links to the company resources.

        Our Join Page contain a form so that the user can fill it out with his data and his company data and then he will be able to get privileges through his membership, on the right side he will be able to see every different membership that we have and its details clicking their button.
